## Contribute to the project
### Two ways to contribute(Pick any one)
* Be the collaborators of this project(please send your github ID to the administrator of this project). 
  > 基于 dev 分支创建自己的开发分支 dev-yourname，在 dev-yourname 上开发完成后，推送 dev-yourname 分支并发起将该分支合并到 dev 分支的 Pull Request，等待管理员审核；
* Fork this project.
  > 不用成为项目成员，直接对该项目进行"派生（Fork）"。修改推送到派生出的项目副本中，并通过创建拉取请求（Pull Request，简称 PR）来让改动进入源版本库。[(参考文档)](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2/GitHub-%E5%AF%B9%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E5%81%9A%E5%87%BA%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AE)

  > General process:
  > 1. 派生一个项目
  > 2. 从 dev 分支创建一个新分支
  > 3. 提交一些修改来改进项目
  > 4. 将这个分支推送到 GitHub 上
  > 5. 创建一个拉取请求
  > 6. 讨论，根据实际情况继续修改
  > 7. 项目的拥有者合并或关闭你的拉取请求
  > 8. 将更新后的 dev 分支同步到你的派生中

### Develop
* 开启本地测试服务器
  * 代码库根目录下开启终端并输入hugo server来启动测试服务器，@http://localhost:1313
  * hugo server会自动侦测源文件变动自动刷新页面
* 网页个性化配置
  * 参考[官方文档](https://wowchemy.com/docs/).
  * Hugo site structure
    > There are 3 main folders for Hugo sites:
    * `content/` for your Markdown-formatted content files (homepage, etc.)
    * `assets/media/` for your media files (images, videos)
    * `config/_default/` for your site configuration files
      > * `config.yaml` to configure Hugo (site title, URL, Hugo options, enable page features)
      > * `params.yaml` to configure Wowchemy options (SEO, site features)
      > * `menus.yaml` to configure your menu links (if the menu is enabled in params.yaml)
      > * `languages.yaml` to configure your site’s language or to set language-specific options in a multilingual site
* Create an author profile[(Guide)](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/authors/)
  * Add a new author profile in command line: 
      
    `hugo new content/authors/firstname-lastname`
  * Then edit the newly created file at `content/authors/firstname-lastname/_index.md`
  * Upload a square photo for the user to the new `authors/firstname-lastname/` folder and name it `avatar`.

    > 2. Use the cd command to navigate to your website folder(the root directory of this repo) in the terminal;
    > 3. Import your publications with: `academic import --bibtex publications.bib`;
    > 4. The generated output in the content/publication folder should be reviewed prior to publishing your site. You can complete the information of the publication in `index.md` by referring to `content/publication/conference-paper/index.md`;
    > 5. Add an image named `featured.*`(e.g. `featured.jpg`) into the publication folder as the cover image.
  * Command line
    > Alternatively, publications can be manually created using the command:
    >
    > `hugo new content/publication/<my-publication>`
    >
    > where `<my-publication>` is the name of your publication, using hyphens (-) instead of spaces.

* Create a blog post[(Guide)](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/blog-posts/)
* 网页部署
  * This site is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
    > Netlify is free and provides ultra-fast global access, automated deployment when you add content, and automatic HTTPS security.
  * When the `main` branch has a new commit and pushed, the site will be deployed automatically.
  * The domain of this site is [air-dream.netlify.app](https://air-dream.netlify.app/).

## We ask you, humbly, to support this open source movement

Today we ask you to defend the open source independence of the Wowchemy website builder and themes 🐧

We're an open source movement that depends on your support to stay online and thriving, but 99.9% of our creators don't give; they simply look the other way.
